4 DOWNBEATS PER LINE - VERTICALLY ALIGNED
========================================

✅ CORRECTED: Each line now has exactly 4 downbeats in RED

VERSE 1 DOWNBEAT STRUCTURE:
Line 1: A - maz - ing Grace, how sweet the sound
        1           1         5      1
        ↓           ↓         ↓      ↓
     (A-)      (Grace)   (sweet) (sound)

Line 2: That saved a wretch like me  
             5    6   4        1
             ↓    ↓   ↓        ↓
          (saved) (a) (wretch) (me)

Line 3: I once was lost, but now am found
          1      1         4      1
          ↓      ↓         ↓      ↓
       (once)  (lost)    (now)  (found)

Line 4: Was blind, but now I see
            1       5    1   1
            ↓       ↓    ↓   ↓
         (blind)  (now) (see) (no word)

VERTICAL ALIGNMENT:
- Column 1: A-, saved, once, blind
- Column 2: Grace, a, lost, now  
- Column 3: sweet, wretch, now, see
- Column 4: sound, me, found, (no word)

MUSICAL ACCURACY:
- 4/4 time signature = 4 downbeats per measure
- Each line = 1 measure
- All downbeats in RED for clear identification
- No black passing chords (removed for clarity)
- Perfect vertical alignment of chord columns

IMPLEMENTATION:
- 4 fixed column positions: 20, 70, 120, 170
- All chord numbers positioned under correct syllables
- RED color (200, 0, 0) for all downbeats
- Clean, readable Nashville Number System format

This creates the perfect foundation for a professional chord chart!
