DOWNBEAT-ONLY ALIGNMENT SYSTEM
==============================

IMPROVEMENT MADE:
- Switched from "every syllable gets a position" to "only downbeats get chord numbers"
- Much cleaner, more readable, and musically accurate
- Natural text flow with precise chord placement only where needed

DOWNBEAT POSITIONS (as specified):
Line 1: a-, grace, sweet, sound
Line 2: saved, wretch, me  
Line 3: once, now, found
Line 4: blind, now, see
Line 5: grace, taught, heart, fear
Line 6: grace, fears, lieved

TECHNICAL APPROACH:
1. Lyrics flow naturally as regular text
2. Chord numbers positioned precisely above downbeat syllables
3. Red color for chord numbers to make them stand out
4. X-coordinates calculated based on approximate syllable positions

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
1      1         5      4    1

That saved a wretch like me
1    5      6       1

Much cleaner than the previous tabbed approach!

MUSICAL ACCURACY:
- Only shows chord changes on actual downbeats
- Follows the natural rhythm of Amazing Grace
- Matches how musicians actually read chord charts
- Eliminates visual clutter from non-chord beats

FILES UPDATED:
- example-amazing-grace-output.pdf (now with downbeat-only alignment)
- test-pdf-generator.cjs (downbeat positioning system)
- backend/functions-v2/pdf-generator/index.js (production-ready downbeat system)

This creates a much more professional and readable Nashville Number chart!
