BEAT-BASED ALIGNMENT SYSTEM:
============================

1. Each syllable/word is aligned to specific musical beats
2. In 3/4 time: beats 1, 4, 7, 10 are downbeats (start of measures)
3. Nashville numbers appear exactly when chord changes occur
4. Dashes (-) indicate held chords or no chord change
5. Fixed-width spacing ensures perfect vertical alignment
6. Red numbers in PDF make chord changes visually distinct

MUSICAL ACCURACY:
================
- Beat 1: A- (1)     - Downbeat, G chord
- Beat 2: maz- (-)   - Hold G chord  
- Beat 3: ing (-)    - Hold G chord

- Beat 6: sweet (-)  - Hold D chord
- Beat 7: the (4)    - New measure, C chord (4th of G)
