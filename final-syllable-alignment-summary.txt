FINAL SYLLABLE-SEPARATED DOWNBEAT ALIGNMENT
===========================================

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:
✅ Syllables separated like "A - maz - ing Grace"
✅ Chord numbers positioned directly under the beginning of downbeat words
✅ RED numbers for downbeats (beats 1, 4, 7, 10...)
✅ BLACK numbers for other chord changes within measures
✅ Precise positioning under correct syllables

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
A - maz - ing  Grace,  how  sweet  the  sound
1              1       5    4      1

That  saved  a  wretch  like  me
      5         6       4     1

I  once  was  lost,  but  now  am  found
   1                   5    4       1

Was  blind,  but  now  I  see
     5       6    4    1

COLOR CODING SYSTEM:
- RED (200, 0, 0): Downbeat chord changes (primary beats)
- BLACK (0, 0, 0): Other chord changes within measures

MUSICAL ACCURACY:
- Downbeats correctly identified: A-, Grace, sweet, sound, saved, wretch, me, once, now, found, blind, now, see
- Additional chord changes shown in black for complete harmonic picture
- Syllable separation matches how the song is actually sung
- Chord numbers positioned precisely under the syllables where changes occur

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- Each line has custom syllable separation and positioning
- X-coordinates calculated for precise alignment
- Color coding applied per chord position
- Both test file and backend PDF generator updated

FILES UPDATED:
- example-amazing-grace-output.pdf (final syllable-separated version)
- test-pdf-generator.cjs (syllable separation with color coding)
- backend/functions-v2/pdf-generator/index.js (production-ready system)
