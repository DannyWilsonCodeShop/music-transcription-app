BEAT-BASED PDF ALIGNMENT FIX SUMMARY
====================================

PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:
- PDF alignment looked messy because jsPDF's default Helvetica font is proportional
- Padded strings with spaces don't align properly in proportional fonts
- Nashville numbers weren't lining up under the correct lyrics

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
- Switched from padded string approach to positioned text rendering
- Each beat gets an exact X-coordinate position (20pt intervals)
- Beat positions: [20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160]
- Both lyrics and numbers use the same position array for perfect alignment

TECHNICAL CHANGES:
1. Updated generateAlignedLyricsAndNumbers() to return arrays instead of padded strings
2. Modified PDF rendering to use doc.text(text, x, y) with exact positions
3. Applied fix to both test files and backend PDF generator

RESULT:
- Perfect vertical alignment between lyrics and Nashville numbers
- Clean, professional appearance matching musical notation standards
- Beat-based system maintains musical accuracy for 3/4 time signature

EXAMPLE ALIGNMENT:
Beat:    1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8
Lyrics:  A-    maz-  ing   Grace, how   sweet the   sound
Numbers: 1     -     -     1     5     -     4     1
X-pos:   20    40    60    80    100   120   140   160

FILES UPDATED:
- example-amazing-grace-output.pdf (main example)
- beat-aligned-amazing-grace.pdf (pure beat-based version)
- test-pdf-generator.cjs (positioned text rendering)
- test-beat-alignment.cjs (positioned text rendering)
- backend/functions-v2/pdf-generator/index.js (positioned text rendering)

The PDF now shows true beat-based alignment with perfect visual formatting!
